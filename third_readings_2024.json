When the Persecution of Decius and Valerian was raging, he withdrew to a cave in the desert. Here, with a palm tree providing him with both food and clothing; he lived a most holy life. He had reached the age of a hundred and thirteen years when Anthony, then ninety years old came to visit him. Paul received him warmly. After they had spent the night in conversing about holy things, Paul said that his death was at hand and asked Anthony to go and get the cloak given him by Athanasius to use as a winding sheet. Anthony went to do this and, as he was on his way back he saw Paul's soul going up to heaven. His body he found in his cell, still in the attitude of prayer. When he had chanted the customary hymns, he wrapped the body in the cloak, but had nothing to dig a grave with. Thereupon two lions came from deep in the desert and hollowed out a place large enough to hold a men's body. Anthony buried the body arranged the grave and went away taking with him the tunic which Paul had woven for himself from palm-leaves. Thereafter he always wore this cloak on the great feasts of Easter and Pentecost.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

At his suggestion the Roman lady Lucina willed her property to God's Church. Because the number of the faithful in the city had increased, he set up new parishes and divided the City into various districts. This angered Maxentius and he threatened Marcellus with heavy punishments unless he would abandon his pontificate and sacrifice to idols. The Pope resisted steadfastly, and so Maxentius had him sent to the stable to take care of the beasts fed at the public expense. Marcellus spent nine months there, and since he could not be present in his parishes in person, he visited them by his letters. He was rescued from this place by some clerics and given hospitality by Lucina in whose house he dedicated a church where he preached to the faithful. Then Maxentius ordered the beasts moved from the stable to the church, so that Marcellus again had to take care of them. The foul atmosphere of the place and his hardships soon proved fatal to Marcellus. He died in the Lord, and was buried in the cemetery of Priscilla on the Salarian Way by blessed Lucina, on January 16.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

He studied at Chieri, where in a short time he earned great praise for his brilliance and his virtue. Ordained priest, he went to Turin, where he made himself all things to all men, and undertook in particular the work of aiding poor and neglected boys. By providing them with teaching in the liberal arts and in trades and keeping them occupied on holidays, he strove with all his might to remove young people from poisonous sources of delinquency and vice. For this purpose, he established two congregations in the Church, one for men and one for women religious. He himself published many books filled with Christian wisdom. He also accomplished great things for the eternal salvation of unbelievers through the missionary enterprises of his congregations. With his mind constantly raised to God, this holy man never seemed to be terrified by threats, worn out by labors, oppressed by cares, or disturbed by adversities. He died in the year of salvation 1888 at the age of seventy-three, and was numbered among the Saints by Pope Pius XI.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

When he had taken his vows, he was an inspiration and example to all by his observance of the rule and zealously promoted the cult of the Virgin Mother of God and of the Rosary. He asked God that he might die as a martyr for the Catholic faith, and this was granted him. For he was appointed leader of the missions which the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith had established at this time for the Grisons and, since he spared himself no toil and converted many heretics to Christ, he incurred the hatred of evil men. So, on the 24th of April in the year 1622, at a church in a place called Sevis, he was struck down with blows and wounds by some heretics who had deceitfully invited him to meet them, pretending to be converts. And thus he consecrated with his own blood the first-fruits of the Martyrs of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

After joining the Society of Jesus, he began at once to defend the Catholic faith against the wiles of the innovators by missions, sermons, and writing books. His one idea was to promote the greater glory of God and it would be impossible to relate how many labors and hardships he went through for more than forty years. He took part more than once in the Council of Trent, travelled on successful missions through many parts of Germany, instructed all classes of society with sound teaching, both public and private, and defended many cities and provinces against the contagion of heresy or brought back to the Catholic faith those tainted by heresy. He was made head of the province of Germany by St. Ignatius, and built houses and colleges in many places. Against the Centuriators of Magdeburg, he wrote two famous volumes, and brought out a summary of Christian doctrine highly approved both by the judgment of theologians and by its long continued use among the people, and many other works in the mother-tongue. From all this, he earned the title of Hammer of the Heretics and second Apostle of Germany. Finally, at Fribourg in Switzerland, at the age of seventy-seven, he rested in the Lord on the 21st day of December, 1597. Pius XI added him to the list of the Saints and at the same time proclaimed him a Doctor of the Universal Church.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

After his course in philosophy, he was first sent to Florence, then to Monreale, Padua, and Louvain; and he filled the offices of teacher and preacher in an admirable way, even though he was not yet a priest. Later he was ordained to the priesthood at Louvain; and he taught theology in such a way as soon to be considered the most famous theologian in all Europe. Recalled to Rome, he taught apologetics in the Roman College, where he was also appointed spiritual director, and led the angelic young Aloysius along the paths of holiness. Over his protests, he was made Cardinal by Pope Clement VIII, and soon after was consecrated bishop, ruling the archdiocese of Capua for three years in a most holy way. He resigned this office to become a counsellor of the highest integrity and loyalty to the Supreme Pontiff in Rome until, when he was almost eighty years old, on the 17th day of September, 1621, he died a holy death in the Lord. Besides his polemical works he wrote many other noteworthy books, among which his little golden Catechism remaineth famous. Pope Pius XI added the name of this strong defender of the Catholic faith to the number of the Saints and declared him a Doctor of the universal Church.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟.

When ordained priest, he renounced, of his own accord, all the ecclesiastical benefits which had been given him, that he might serve God in greater tranquillity. When he incurred a serious illness in Salamanca, he bound himself by vow to observe a severer discipline. To do so, he went to the monastery of St. Augustine, where there flourished the greatest severity of discipline. As a religious, he excelled the most advanced monks in all virtues. Through his public talks and private conversations, as well as the holiness of his life, he brought back to peaceful living the citizens of Salamanca, who had been disturbed by bloody factions. In the course of this work, he was not infrequently saved from imminent death by divine power. The Lord Christ often appeared to him while he was celebrating Mass. Often also he could divine the secrets of hearts and foretell the future. At length, having predicted the day of his death, he departed this life in a most holy way, glorified by many miracles both before and after his death. These miracles were duly proved, and Alexander VIII enrolled him in the number of the Saints.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

Summoned to preach the Gospel of Christ Jesus in Pontus, he called that province back to the way of salvation.

He built monasteries, ordering the monastic life so that it would best combine the advantages of the solitary life with those of the active life.

For in some inexplicable way, I know not what, every one that loveth himself, and not God, loveth not himself; and whoever loveth God, and not himself, he it is that loveth himself. For he that cannot live by himself will certainly die by loving himself; he therefore loveth not himself that loveth himself to his own loss of life.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

When Polycarp was taken up to heaven with the glory of martyrdom, Irenaeus strove with incredible zeal to learn what articles of belief the others who were instructed by the Apostles had received to be preserved in the deposit of faith. For this reason he brought together as many of these men as he could, and whatever he heard from them he carefully retained in his memory to bring out later at an opportune time against the heretics. He went to Gaul and was made priest at the church of Lyon by Photinus the bishop. When he succeeded Photinus he carried out the work of his bishopric most successfully: by his wisdom, prayer and example, in a short time, he had rid not only the citizens of Lyon, but also the inhabitants of many other cities of Gaul, from superstition and error, and had enrolled them in the army of Christ. He wrote many works, a great part of which had perished through the ravages of time. Five of his books against heretics are extant, in the third of which he gives to the Roman Church and to the succession of her bishops a testimony surpassing all others in weight and brilliancy, calling her the faithful, perpetual and sure guardian of divine tradition. For he said that it is necessary to the whole Church (that is, those who are of the faithful in all places) should agree with the Roman Church, because of its eminent primacy. Crowned with martyrdom, he went to heaven in the year of salvation 202.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

Here, when Apollinaris had converted many pagans to faith in Christ, he was seized by the priests of the idols and beaten severely. When his prayers brought the gift of speech to a nobleman named Boniface who had been dumb for a long time and freed his daughter from an unclean spirit, a commotion was again raised against Apollinaris, and he suffered many kinds of torments. Afterwards, preaching the Gospel throughout Emilia, he turned many of the people away from the worship of idols. He came back to Ravenna, exhorted the Christians to constancy in the faith and died the glorious death of a martyr. His body was buried near the city wall.\n℣.

In the defence of Pampeluna, he was wounded. As he lay in a long convalescence, the chance reading of some holy books gave him a burning desire to follow in the footsteps of Christ and the Saints. He went to Montserrat, hung up his arms before the Altar of the Blessed Virgin, and spent a whole night in prayer, thus entering on his new profession of holy warfare. The austerity of his life was extraordinary. He was ignorant of letters but, refreshed by brilliant illuminations from God, he composed the Exercises, a wonderful book approved by the Apostolic See and also by its usefulness to everyone. At Paris he was joined by nine companions of different nations all studying at the university, and there at Montmartre he laid the first foundations of the Society of Jesus which were later completed at Rome. To the three customary vows was added one to carry out the command of the Apostolic See concerning the Missions. Ignatius gave aid in increasing the beauty of churches, in teaching catechism, and in fostering attendance at sermons and the reception of the sacraments. He was most zealous for the spread of the Christian religion everywhere, and exercised a wonderful power over demons. In the sixty-fifth year of his age, he went to receive the embrace of his Lord, whose greater glory he had always sought in all things. Pius XI appointed and declared him the heavenly patron of all spiritual exercises or retreats.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

In obedience to his father he became a lawyer; but when he had experienced the dangers of this kind of career, he abandoned the profession. He renounced his right of inheritance as oldest son and became a priest, attacking vice with such zeal that he obtained the conversions of a great number of sinners. He took special pity on the poor and those living in rural districts and founded the Congregation of Priests of the Most Holy Redeemer to preach the Gospel to them. Lest anything should turn him from his determination, he bound himself by a perpetual vow never to waste any time. Constant in contemplating the Passion of the Lord and the holy Eucharist, he was outstanding in his devotion to the holy Mother of God, being more than once refreshed by signs of her heavenly protection. He wrote many books of religious instruction and of devotion by which he strove to gain souls for Christ. He consistently refused the ecclesiastical honours offered to him, but was compelled by the Holy See to accept the Bishopric of the Church of Santa Agata dei Goti, where he was generous to the poor and made himself all things to all men. He also brought nuns back to a more perfect form of life. Serious chronic illnessses led him to resign the episcopal office and return to his disciples. Finally, at the age of ninety years, radiant with innocence of life and penance, he died a most peaceful death in the year 1787. Pope Pius IX declared him a Doctor of the universal Church, and Pius XII established him as the heavenly patron before God of all confessors and moral theologians.\n℣.

He founded hospitals with his own money, and with his own hands served the sick, even those stricken with contagious diseases. He worked so zealously for the salvation of others that he came to be called Hunter of souls. The discipline of the clergy had fallen to a low state; with the aim of restoring it after the pattern of the apostolic life, Cajetan founded the Order of Clerks Regular. They were to give up all involvement in worldly affairs; they were not to possess any revenues or to beg for their subsistence from the faithful, but to live only on alms spontaneously offered. And so, with the approval of Clement VII, Cajetan took solemn vows at the High Altar of the Vatican Basilica, together with John Peter Carafa, Bishop of Chieti and afterwards Paul IV, and two other men of outstandingly holy lives. He was a great advancer of care in the worship of God, of splendour in the house of God, of exactness in the holy ceremonies, and of the frequent reception of the most holy Eucharist.

As an eight year old boy, keeping sheep, he would lead the other children to kneel before the image of the Mother of God, teaching them the rosary by word and example: and he loved to work in the fields and meditate on divine things.

He was slow to learn, but after imploring God's help, and working hard to complete his course in theology, he was judged fit to be ordained. Receiving an appointment as pastor he made spiritual flowers bloom again in a parish that had been nothing but a dried up wasteland. Busy every day hearing confessions and giving spiritual counsel, he bore patiently the most horrible attacks of Satan. He established a practice of making missions in more than a hundred parishes. The faithful came flocking to his parish, even from distant places in a holy desire to see him; but he did not share their high opinion of him, and more than once he tried to slip away. Worn out by his labors rather than his old age, he rested in the Lord at the age of seventy-three, on the day he had foretold, August 4, 1859. Famous for many miracles, he was enrolled among the Blessed by Pius X, and among the Saints by Pius XI, who on the fiftieth anniversary of his own priesthood, appointed him the heavenly patron of all parish priests.\n℣.

At the age of twenty-two he entered the monastery of Citeaux, from which the Cistercian Order taketh its name, and brought with him his brothers and many others to undertake the same religious life. He applied himself to vigils and prayer in a wonderful way. The virtues of humility, mercy, kindness, prudence shone out in him, together with constant zeal for meditating on divine things. He was made Abbot of Clairvaux and built monasteries in many places where his principles and discipline flourished for a long time. He also wrote many works in which it is clear that he had been instructed by teaching given him from heaven rather than by his own labour. Because he was implored by great princes to settle their disputes and to arrange the affairs of the Church, he went often to Italy, and was of great assistance to Pope Innocent II in confuting the schism of Peter de Leone. At the age of sixty-three, he fell asleep in the Lord, having earned great honour from the Church.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

When her husband was killed while hunting, she made a vow of continence, and she so mastered herself that she did not hesitate to act as godmother to the son of the man who killed her husband. Lest later on she should be moved from her determination to observe chastity, she renewed her vow and inscribed the most holy Name of Jesus on her breast with a hot iron. With St. Francis de Sales as her spiritual director, who taught her the divine will, she laid the foundations of the religious Institute of the Visitation of Holy Mary, which she spread far and wide.

He never slackened in his constant zeal for prayer, even though he was tormented in various ways by the wiles of the devil, who sometimes even dealt him blows. Each night for six months before his death, he heard angelic melodies; and at length, having foretold the day of his death, he fell asleep in the Lord. He was famous for miracles both before and after his death, and was enrolled among the Saints by Eugene IV.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

      "englishThirdReading": "Reading 3\nThe honoured name of the Virgin Mary, which is said to mean Star of the Sea, is most fitting for the Virgin Mother. She may well be compared to a star; for, as a star beameth forth its rays without any diminution of its own lustre, so too the Virgin gave birth to a Son with no loss to her virginity. The departing rays do not lessen the star's brightness, nor Mary's Son her ínviolate maidenhood. She is, therefore, that noble star risen from Jacob and raised by nature above this great and wide sea. She shineth with merits, she enlighteneth with her example. Ye, all ye that are cast about upon sea of temporalities in storms and tempests more than ye walk on solid land, turn ye not your eyes away from the brightness of this star. Think of Mary, call on Mary, so that ye may experience for yourself how fittingly it was said, And the Virgin's name was Mary. - Pope Innocent XI ordered the Feast of this most holy name, which had already been honoured with a special rite in some parts of the Christian world, to be celebrated each year by the universal Church as a perpetual memorial of the great blessing of that signal victory won at Vienna in Austria over the cruel Turkish tyrant who had been grinding down the Christian people.\n℣.

When the Prefect Lysias learnt to what faith they belonged, he commanded them to be brought before him, and questioned them as to their way of life, and the confession of their religion; and then, forasmuch as they freely owned themselves Christians and the Christian faith needful to salvation, he commanded them to worship the gods, under threats of torments and a most cruel death.

These difficulties she courageously overcame and happily entered the Carmel of Lisieux at the age of fifteen There she burned with love for God and neighbor. She followed the spiritual way of childhood according to the teaching of the Gospels, and taught it to others, especially to the novices.

At the age of twenty-four, on September 30, 1897 she hastened to her heavenly Bridegroom.

She was so affected by meditating on the Passion of the Lord that she could not think thereon without tears. She was given in marriage to Ulpho, Prince of Nericia, and urged him to godly works, as well by her noble example as by her earnest words. She educated her children most devoutly and served the poor and the sick. Her husband became a Cistercian monk and died soon after, and Bridget thereupon adopted a more austere way of life. Many secret things were then divinely revealed to her. She founded the monastery of Vadstena under the Rule of the Holy Saviour, and went to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage.

This aroused against John the bitter complaints of wicked men, but he bore everything with serenity of mind, obtaining the confirmation of his congregation from Gregory XIII. He was very sorrowful over the multitudes in distant parts who lacked the light of the Gospel and, having taken counsel with the devout leader Vives, he founded an institute of Priests whose work was to form young men who would be sent to propagate the faith in far countries.

The Pope aroused by this crime, gathered at Rome a council of one hundred and five bishops, who condemned Paul. During the council the emperor sent the exarch Olympius to Italy, to depose the Pope. But Olympius died a miserable death, after failing to harm Martin in any way. Then, on the emperor’s orders, Theodore Kalliopes took over the Lateran Basilica and the nearby residence of the pope, and arrested Martin, first sending him to the island of Naxos, and then bringing him to Constantinople. Here the holy pope was chained and suffered mockery and insults.

Eventually, having deteriorated with age this basilica was rebuilt from its foundations with greater magnificence.

In the same way, the basilica of St. Paul on the Ostian Way was very richly built by Emperor Constantine and consecrated by St. Sylvester. Then, after it had been destroyed by a great fire, it was rebuilt more splendidly than before by the untiring devotion of four popes.

      "englishThirdReading": "Reading 3\nBorn of a noble family at Osimo in Picenum, Sylvester was remarkable even as a boy for his scholarship and his good character. Having duly studied the sacred sciences and been made a canon, he benefited the people by his example and his preaching. When, at the funeral of a certain dead nobleman, he saw the decaying corpse of the handsome man who had been his neighbor, he said, \"I am what this man was; what he is, I shall be\"; and soon, from a desire for greater perfection, he withdrew into solitude and there devoted himself to vigils, prayers and fasting. That he might hide more completely from men's eyes, he changed his location several times. Finally he went to Monte Fano; a place deserted at that time, where he built a church in honor of St. Benedict and laid the foundation of the Congregation of the Sylvestrines. There his monks saw in him a wonderful model of holiness; he was famous for the spirit of prophecy, for power over demons and for other gifts, which in his deep humility he always kept hidden. He fell asleep in the Lord in the year of salvation 1267.\n℣. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us.\n℟. Thanks be to God."

Her parents, Flavian and Dafrosa, suffered martyrdom under Julian the Apostate. Then Bibiana and her sister, Demetria, were deprived of all their possessions, and Apronianus, praetor of the City, attempted, both by promises and by threats, to make them abandon the true faith.

Next Bibiana herself was handed over to a very crafty woman called Rufina, who was to have her seduced. But Bibiana was victorious over all her wiles, and thwarted the praetor's evil designs. Then he commanded that she be beaten with leaded whips, and at length she breathed out her soul. Her sacred body, left exposed to the dogs for two days, was preserved unharmed by divine power.

In Paris, he joined the companions and disciples of St. Ignatius, and in a short time became a shining example of austerity of life and untiring contemplation of divine things. Paul III made him apostolic nuncio to India, and he traveled about through countless provinces, always on foot and often barefoot. He brought the faith to Japan and six other regions. In India he converted many hundreds of thousands to Christianity, cleansing many princes and kings in the holy waters of baptism. His humility was so great that, when he wrote to St. Ignatius, his general, he always did so on his knees. By many and wonderful miracles, the Lord confirmed his zealous work in spreading the Gospel.
